Reimplementations of GANs

## MNIST DCGAN
- File: [`dcganmnist/mnist.py`](dcganmnist/mnist.py)
- Assumes availability of [`tensorflow/models/official`](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) in `PYTHONPATH`. See instructions [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official#requirements).
- Inspired by DCGAN architecture, but altered the architecture based on what I found in [`osh/KerasGAN`](https://github.com/osh/KerasGAN).
